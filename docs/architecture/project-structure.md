# Project Structure

Repository root:
- contains Docker files
- contains README
- contains package.json

Backend root:
- ./

Commands must be executed from repository root unless explicitly specified.

Main commands:

Development:
- npm run dev

Production:
- npm start

Testing:
- npm test

NEVER execute commands from nested directories unless package.json exists there.

Before running commands:
1. verify current working directory
2. verify package.json location
3. verify node_modules location

The repository is NOT a monorepo.
